# 1. Be proactive

Take the initiative to respond positively and improve the situation.

# 2. Begin with the end in mind

Are you who you want to be? How do you want to be remembered?

##### All things are created twice

Before one acts, one should act in one's mind first. Before creating something, measure twice. Do not just act; think first: Is this how I want it to go, and are these the correct consequences? 

If habit 1 advises changing one's life to act and be proactive, habit 2 advises that **"you are the programmer"**

# 3. Put first things first

1. \    Quadrant I. Urgent and important (Do) – important deadlines and crises
2. \    Quadrant II. Not urgent but important (Plan) – long-term development
3. \    Quadrant III. Urgent but not important (Delegate) – distractions with deadlines
4. \    Quadrant IV. Not urgent and not important (Eliminate) – frivolous distractions

If habit 2 advises that "you are the programmer", habit 3 advises: "**write the program, become a leader**". Keep personal integrity by minimizing the difference between what you say versus what you do

# 4. "Think win–win"

It isn't about being nice, nor is it a quick-fix technique; it is a character-based code for human interaction and collaboration

# 5. "Seek first to understand, then to be understood"

Use empathetic listening to genuinely understand a person



# 6. Synergize

Achieve goals that no one could have done alone



# 7: "Sharpen the saw"

Exercise. Meditate. Drink Water. Don't eat junk.
